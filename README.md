# AI PR Review Agent

A production-grade, open source AI Pull Request Review Agent. A developer opens a PR. A webhook fires. Four specialist sub-agents run in parallel — security, code quality, test coverage, docs. Each one reasons over the diff plus codebase context retrieved via semantic search. An aggregator merges findings into a single structured review and posts it back to the PR. Low-confidence findings route to a human approval queue.

Every phase has a gate: tests pass, evals pass, a written checkpoint before the next phase begins.

## What It Does

- Receives a GitHub PR webhook
- Runs 4 parallel specialist sub-agents: security, quality, test coverage, docs
- Each agent reasons about its domain using the PR diff + codebase context (RAG via pgvectorscale)
- Posts structured review comments back to the GitHub PR
- Routes low-confidence findings to a human approval queue (HITL)
- Every agent action, LLM call, and decision is recorded in a Tiger Cloud hypertable
- Real-time cost and latency dashboards powered by Tiger continuous aggregates
- Learns from merged vs rejected reviews over time

## Data Layer — Tiger Cloud (TimescaleDB)

Most AI projects end up juggling three separate stores: a vector DB for RAG, a time-series store for traces, and Postgres for structured data. This project uses [Tiger Cloud](https://tigerdata.com) — a managed TimescaleDB instance — to collapse all three into one Postgres database.

One connection pool. One backup policy. One place to reason about the data.

### Three roles, one database

| Layer | Tiger Feature | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Semantic memory | pgvectorscale DiskANN | Stores chunked code, ADRs, and prior reviews. 4 specialist agents query it for context on every PR. Replaces Qdrant entirely. |
| Agent events | Hypertables | Every span, LLM call, tool call, and decision lands in one time-ordered table: `agent_events`. Powers the trace viewer, audit trail, and cost ledger. |
| Live dashboards | Continuous aggregates | Real-time rollups for cost per PR, p95 latency per agent, rejection rate. Materialized so the dashboard stays fast as history grows from GBs to TBs. |
| Cost control | Hypertables + aggregates | Token cost attribution per agent span. Budget caps read from the same aggregate the dashboard does. |
| Coding agent | Tiger MCP | The coding agent driving the build is wired to Tiger via MCP. It introspects schemas, runs queries, and verifies migrations live. |

### Schema sketch

```sql
-- The events spine — every agent action as a time-ordered row
CREATE TABLE agent_events (
  ts          TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  review_id   UUID        NOT NULL,
  agent       TEXT        NOT NULL,   -- security | quality | tests | docs
  event_type  TEXT        NOT NULL,   -- span.start | llm.call | tool.call | decision
  model       TEXT,
  tokens_in   INT,
  tokens_out  INT,
  cost_usd    NUMERIC(10,6),
  latency_ms  INT,
  outcome     TEXT,
  payload     JSONB
);

SELECT create_hypertable('agent_events', 'ts', chunk_time_interval => INTERVAL '1 day');

-- Continuous aggregate: per-agent cost and latency, refreshed every minute
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW agent_health_1m
WITH (timescaledb.continuous) AS
SELECT
  time_bucket('1 minute', ts)    AS bucket,
  agent,
  sum(cost_usd)                  AS cost_usd,
  approx_percentile(0.95, percentile_agg(latency_ms)) AS p95_ms
FROM agent_events
GROUP BY bucket, agent;

-- Semantic memory with pgvectorscale DiskANN
CREATE TABLE code_chunks (
  id        UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  repo      TEXT NOT NULL,
  path      TEXT NOT NULL,
  content   TEXT NOT NULL,
  embedding VECTOR(1536) NOT NULL,
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE INDEX code_chunks_emb_idx ON code_chunks
  USING diskann (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
```

## Tiger Cloud Setup

1. Sign up at [tigerdata.com/go/kol](https://tigerdata.com/go/kol) — $1,000 in free credits
2. Create a **Hybrid applications** service (TimescaleDB + pgvectorscale)
3. Copy your connection string and add to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Set TIGER_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://tsdbadmin:...@host.tsdb.cloud.timescale.com:port/tsdb?sslmode=require
```

4. Run the migration:

```bash
psql $TIGER_DATABASE_URL < scripts/migrations/2026-06-tiger-init.sql
```

5. Wire Tiger MCP into Claude Code (optional, for on-camera demo):

```bash
tiger mcp install   # select Claude Code
```

Full MCP setup guide: `scripts/setup-tiger-mcp.md`

Architecture decision record: `docs/adr/ADR-003-tiger-cloud-data-layer.md`

---

## Local Development

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # fill in TIGER_DATABASE_URL, GITHUB_TOKEN, OPENAI_API_KEY
docker compose up             # starts Redis + API + Worker
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.
Health check: `GET /health`

## Key Design Decisions

- Tiger replaces both Qdrant (vectors) and plain Postgres (structured) — one connection, one backup
- Redis stays for the ARQ job queue (right tool for that job)
- `agent_events` hypertable is the single source of truth for traces, costs, and audit
- Continuous aggregates keep the dashboard fast at any scale — no full table scans
- DiskANN index over `code_chunks` gives 28x lower p95 latency than Pinecone at 99% recall
- HITL threshold is confidence-weighted — low-confidence findings queue for human review
